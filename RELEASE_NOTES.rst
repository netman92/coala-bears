coala-bears 0.8.0
=================

For this release, we have had 19 contributors from around the world
contributing 176 commits to just coala-bears in the past 9 weeks.

Here are the important changes and additions:

**New Bears**

- ``CSecurityBear`` - Lints C/C++ files and identifies possible security
  issues.
  `[CSecurityBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/CSecurityBear.rst>`__

- ``HappinessLintBear`` - Checks JavaScript files for semantic and syntax
  errors using ``happiness``.
  `[HappinessLintBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/HappinessLintBear.rst>`__

- ``WriteGoodLintBear`` - Lints the text files using ``write-good`` to
  improve proses.
  `[WriteGoodLintBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/WriteGoodLintBear.rst>`__

- ``coalaBear`` - Checks for the correct spelling and casing of ``coala``
  in the text files.
  `[coalaBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/coalaBear.rst>`__

- ``VultureBear`` - Checks Python code for unused variables and functions
  using ``vulture``.
  `[VultureBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/VultureBear.rst>`__

- ``YapfBear`` - Checks and corrects the formatting of Python code using
  ``yapf`` utility.
  `[YapfBear documentation] <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/YapfBear.rst>`__

**Major API Changes**

- Settings unification - most bears have seen API changes. Settings' names
  are now consistent across bears. This supports backwards
  compatibility, however (but with a deprecation notice). You can find the
  whole list `here <http://dpaste.com/3EP5GCV>`_.

**New Features**

- Bear upload tool - this is a part of the complete decentralization of
  bears. With this tool, bears are uploaded as individual packages to PyPI
  and just the necessary bears (and their dependencies) can be installed.

- Also as a part of the decentralization process, several bears now have
  the ``REQUIREMENTS`` attribute. This is one of the requirement objects
  supporting various package managers such as ``apt-get``, ``dnf``,
  ``yum``, ``pip``, ``npm``, ``gem``, and so on. To learn more, please
  see the ``coala`` `0.8.0 release changelog <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.rst>`__.

- Several bears now support the ``ASCIINEMA_URL`` attribute. This contains
  an URL to an asciinema video displaying the bear's working.

**Bug Fixes**

- An issue in ``FilenameBear`` involving files with fully capitalized names
  has been resolved. `Pull #687 <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/pull/687>`_

- Various corner cases with ``InvalidLinkBear`` involving some false positives
  and false negatives have been fixed.
  `Issue #691 <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/issues/691>`_

**Documentation**

- A complete overhaul of the README page with a special emphasis on design
  and user-friendliness.

**Regressions**

- Python 3.3 support was dropped.
